Each \nshipment of Supply Deliverables delivered to Purchaser shall be accompanied by a written certificate of compliance, \nexecuted by an authorized officer of Supplier, confirming that the Supply Deliverables were manufactured in \naccordance with the Specifications and Regulatory Standards (\u201cCertificate of Compliance\u201d). \n3.2 Samples; Quality Control Audits. Supplier shall maintain, and shall cause its Third Party vendors to maintain, \nsample units for each batch of Supply Deliverables for a period of `Sample_Retention_Period` after Supplier delivers such Supply \nDeliverables to Purchaser, or longer if required by law. After such time period, Supplier shall notify Purchaser prior \nto the destruction or disposal of any sample units retained under this Section 3.2 and, `Sample_Delivery_Request_Condition`, \nSupplier shall deliver or cause to be delivered such sample units to Purchaser in lieu of such destruction or disposal, \nall at `Quality_Control_Audit_Expense`.

If the indemnifying party elects to settle or defend such claim, it shall notify the indemnified party \n`Indemnification_Defense_Notice_Period` (but in no event less than `Indemnification_Defense_Notice_Period_Short` before any pleading, filing or response on behalf of the indemnified \nparty is due) of its intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to settle or defend such claim or fails to notify \nthe indemnified party of its election `Indemnification_Defense_Notice_Period_2` (or such shorter period as provided above) after receipt of the \nindemnified party\u2019s notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder, the indemnified party shall have the right to contest, \nsettle or compromise the claim without prejudice to any rights to indemnification hereunder.

So long as the indemnifying party is reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith as \npermitted herein, the indemnified party shall not pay or settle any such claim. The controlling party shall deliver, or \ncause to be delivered, to the other party copies of all correspondence, pleadings, motions, briefs, appeals or other \nwritten statements submitted in connection with the settlement or defense of any such claim, and timely notices of, \nand the right to participate pursuant to (iii) above in any hearing or other court proceeding relating to such claim. \nARTICLE 8 \nCONFIDENTIALITY. \n8.1 Confidentiality.
